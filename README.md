### Description

This Rust program demonstrates RSA encryption and decryption, a widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm. 
It generates random prime numbers, calculates public and private keys, and encrypts/decrypts a message using BigInt arithmetic.


### Features

Prime number generation<br>
Modular exponentiation<br>
Encryption and decryption of a given message<br>
Handling ASCII encoding and decoding<br>
Public and private key calculation<br>

### Usage
