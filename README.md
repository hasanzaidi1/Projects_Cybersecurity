## Project 1: Securing The Message Software

### Description

This Rust program demonstrates RSA encryption and decryption, a widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm. 
It generates random prime numbers, calculates public and private keys, and encrypts/decrypts a message using BigInt arithmetic.


### Features

Prime number generation<br>
Modular exponentiation<br>
Encryption and decryption of a given message<br>
Handling ASCII encoding and decoding<br>
Public and private key calculation<br>

### Usage

To use this program, ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed. Simply clone the repository and run the program:

  #### Clone the repository
  git clone https://github.com/hasanzaid1/Projects_Cybersecurity.git
  
  #### Navigate to the project directory
  cd rsa-encryption-rust
  
  #### Run the program using Cargo
  cargo run
